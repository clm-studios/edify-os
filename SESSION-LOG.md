# SESSION-LOG — Async UX Hardening Agent

**Identity:** Async UX Hardening Agent (Sonnet)
**Branch:** `lopmon/fix-async-ux-hardening`
**Worktree:** `C:/Users/Araly/edify-os-async-ux-fix-20260511`
**Date:** 2026-05-11
**Task:** Bundle three coordinated fixes addressing the class of bugs where
long-running tool chains hang indefinitely past Vercel's 60s function ceiling
with no UI error feedback. Sourced from smoke-test-findings-2026-05-11.md
(bugs 1 + 2).

## What shipped

### Fix 1: Per-source timeout protection inside long-running tools

**`apps/web/src/lib/with-timeout.ts`** (new) — small `withTimeout(promise, ms,
fallback, onTimeout?)` utility racing a promise against a timer. Used by three
sites in this PR. Documents the caveat that the losing promise keeps running
in the background until the request tears down (source helpers don't accept
AbortSignals yet — plumb-through is left for a follow-up since changing each
helper's signature touched too many files).

**`apps/web/src/lib/grant-matcher.ts`** — wrapped each of the 4 source fan-out
calls (grants.gov, ca_grants, federal_register, foundation_grant_history) in
`withTimeout(..., 8000)`. On timeout the source resolves to `null` → the
mapper returns `[]` and the source label gets recorded in `sourceErrors` with
message `"timeout"`. Also bounded the Grants.gov amount-enrichment per-grant
fetch and the Sonnet judge call (the judge gets an `AbortController` with a
30s deadline via the SDK's `{ signal }` request option).

**`apps/web/src/lib/tools/render.ts`** — wrapped the full HTML→PNG+upload
pipeline in `withTimeout(..., 45000)` with a discriminated-union outcome shape
(`{ ok: true, ... } | { ok: false, reason: 'timeout' | 'failed', message }`)
so the caller switches on `ok` rather than checking instanceof / sentinel
equality. On timeout the tool returns an `is_error: true` content explaining
the failure so the model can apologize / suggest simpler HTML.

### Fix 2: `maxDuration` configured in `vercel.json`

**`apps/web/vercel.json`** — added a `functions` block with `maxDuration: 60`
on the chat-streaming route plus the decision-lab, heartbeat, and briefing
routes (all of which can fire multi-step tool chains). Vercel Hobby's hard
ceiling is 60s; without explicit config the SDK defaults to 10s, which is
what was likely killing the streams long before our app-level timeouts could
react.

### Fix 3: Server-side stream-end cleanup + DB status + frontend retry UI

**`supabase/migrations/00036_message_error_status.sql`** (new) — adds
`messages.status` text column with check constraint
(`'streaming' | 'complete' | 'errored'`), defaults to `'complete'`, plus a
partial index on rows where `status <> 'complete'` so the frontend's
rehydrate query stays cheap as the table grows. **Manual apply required by
Citlali in Supabase SQL Editor** (same workflow as 00027/00028).

**`apps/web/src/app/api/team/[slug]/chat/route.ts`** — restructured the
streaming handler:

- Assistant message row is now pre-inserted with `status='streaming'` *before*
  the stream starts (instead of after, post-completion). The pre-insert
  returns the real DB ID, which becomes `msgId` and is sent to the frontend
  via the `meta` event.
- Success path: the existing post-stream side-effects were rewritten from
  `INSERT` to `UPDATE` on `msgId`, setting `status='complete'` and the final
  content + token_usage metadata.
- Failure path: added `try/catch/finally` around the stream body. The `catch`
  sets `streamErrored = true` and surfaces the SSE error event as before; the
  new `finally` writes `status='errored'` with whatever partial text the
  `onTextDelta` callback accumulated, so a refresh later still shows the
  partial response with a retry affordance.

**`apps/web/src/app/api/team/[slug]/messages/route.ts`** — the GET endpoint
now selects and returns `status` so the frontend can use it during
rehydrate.

**`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/team/[slug]/api.ts`** — added `status?:
'streaming' | 'complete' | 'errored'` to the `Message` type.

**`apps/web/src/app/dashboard/team/[slug]/TeamChatClient.tsx`** — two changes:

1. **Stall detection during streaming:** the SSE consumer now arms a 90s
   timer that resets on every chunk. If the timer fires (server went silent
   — e.g. function timeout), the AbortController fires and a flag
   (`stallAborted`) tells the catch block to render the existing error-card
   shape with a "request timed out" message + retry button.
2. **DB-status respect on rehydrate:** new helper `projectErroredMessages`
   walks the messages array and converts any `assistant` row with
   `status='errored'` into the existing `isError + failedMessageText` shape,
   reusing the most recent prior user message as the retry text. Any
   partial assistant content captured server-side is preserved with a
   "timed out before completion" italic suffix so the user can see how far
   the response got.

## Needs Citlali action

**Apply migration 00036** in the Supabase SQL Editor before merging /
deploying. Paste the contents of
`supabase/migrations/00036_message_error_status.sql`. Until that runs:

- The chat route's insert of `status: 'streaming'` will succeed (column has
  default `'complete'`) but the value will be silently ignored — meaning
  errored streams will still appear as `complete` on rehydrate.
- The GET messages endpoint's `select("... status")` will return `null` for
  status; the frontend's fallback (`?? "complete"`) keeps the dead-state UI
  from breaking, but the retry-card-on-rehydrate fix won't kick in until the
  column exists.

The stall detection + maxDuration + per-source timeouts work without the
migration — they're all app-side. The migration just unlocks the cross-mount
"retry on refresh" piece.

## Known limitations

1. **`withTimeout` doesn't cancel the underlying HTTP call.** Source helpers
   in `apps/web/src/lib/{grants-gov,ca-grants-portal,federal-register,foundation-grants}.ts`
   don't accept an `AbortSignal` yet — refactoring all four was scope creep
   for this PR. The losing fetch keeps running in the background until the
   serverless function tears down. Real fix: thread `signal` through each
   helper. Logged for a future PR.

2. **Frontend retry button on rehydrate** projects errored DB rows onto the
   existing `isError + failedMessageText` UI. If multiple user messages
   precede the errored assistant, the retry sends the *most recent* prior
   user message — which is correct for normal flow but could pick the wrong
   one in unusual interleavings. Acceptable for the dead-state class of
   bugs; tighten if it bites in practice.

3. **No test coverage** added for the new code paths. The existing repo has
   no test harness for the chat-streaming route. Verifying the fixes will be
   smoke-test driven (re-run the find_grants_for_org + render_design_to_image
   reproductions from smoke-test-findings-2026-05-11.md after migration 00036
   is applied).

## Verification

- `pnpm typecheck` — passes (4/4 packages green).
- No lint script exists in `apps/web/package.json`; relied on TS strictness.
